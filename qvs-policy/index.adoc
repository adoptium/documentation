AQAvit Quality Verification Suite
---------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.aqavit[AQAvit^]
is the quality evaluation project for Java SE runtimes and associated technology. AQAvit takes a functionally complete Java runtime and ensures that all the additional qualities are present that make it suitable for production use. These quality criteria include good performance, exceptional security, resilience and endurance, and the ability to pass a wide variety of application test suites.
