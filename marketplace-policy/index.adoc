Overview
~~~~~~~~

The
https://www.adoptium.net/marketplace[Adoptium marketplace^]
provides users easy access to a wide variety of high-quality OpenJDK Java binaries, and the organizations producing those binaries a mechanism to broaden the distribution of their Java runtimes.

User Benefits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every binary available via the Adoptium marketplace website and API has demonstrated that it is ready for production use in a wide variety of environment by passing the AQAVit Quality Verification suite.

The AQAvit suite evaluates Java runtimes for functional correctness, performance, resilience, security, and the ability to pass a wide variety of application test suites. As a result, enterprises can be confident in the OpenJDK binaries they’re bringing into their companies and incorporating into their software supply chains.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following benefits are enjoyed by all products listed in the Adoptium marketplace.

 * Demonstrates that the product is a high quality offering, ready for enterprise usage, having passed the required Java-compatibility and AQAvit quality inclusion criteria.
 * Shows the product meets all the Eclipse Adoptium Working Group requirements for security, scalability, durability, and functional correctness at a specific version and build.
 * Declares the provider is a participant in the Adoptium community and supports the definition and scope of the AQAvit quality criteria across the industry.
 * Inclusion in the marketplace is open to all strategic and enterprise members at no additional cost to the provider, is non-exclusive, and preserves the opportunity to supply paid services alongside the offering.
 * Listed products benefit from Adoptium Working Group sponsored marketing and promotion initiatives across the industry with support of the Eclipse Foundation.

AQAvit Software Product Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only those products that pass the AQAVit software product verification test suite and comply with the obligations of the QVSL may be included in the Adoptium Marketplace.

NOTE: It is necessary to verify every binary that wishes to be included in the Adoptium Marketplace.

It is not necessary to be an Adoptium working group member to produce an AQAvit verified software product.


Java SE Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compliance with the Java SE Specification is determined exclusively through the use of Oracle’s
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Compatibility_Kit[Technology Compatibility Kit^]
(TCK) for the Java Platform, also referred to as the Java Compatibility Kit (JCK).

The JCK test kit is the property of Oracle, and is not available under an open source license. Eclipse does not test third-party software products for Java compatibility. Developers should approach Oracle to secure their own license to use the JCK for such purposes.
